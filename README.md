So let me tell you about my application. It's a pretty advanced payment monitoring system, and it's all available through a web app that's built natively.
Here's what it does:

1.Payment Tracking: This app keeps a close eye on bank transactions, no matter what payment method you're using. It's like your financial watchdog.

2.Interactive Dashboard: To make sense of all this data, I've hooked up with Power BI to create a cool dashboard. This dashboard doesn't just show you what's happening now, but it also gives you a history lesson on transactions. It's all about helping you make the best decisions.

3.Filters for Transactions: You're not just looking at everything; you can filter transactions based on certain criteria. For example, you can sift out transactions with high cheque rejection rates. This helps you figure out why some cheques are bouncing.

4.Fraud Busting: Now here's where things get interesting. My app can sniff out potential fraud cases. It's like having a Sherlock Holmes for financial transactions. It uses data analytics and clever algorithms to spot banks with a higher-than-normal fraud rate. This information is gold for financial institutions looking to keep their house in order.

5.Signature Check: But we're not stopping there. I've got a feature that uses data mining algorithms to check signatures on cheques. It's like having a digital handwriting expert. It makes sure the signature on a cheque matches the client's real signature. This extra layer of security helps keep fraudulent transactions at bay.

6.Native Web App: Oh, and the best part? It's all on a web app that's built natively. This means it works smoothly on any device you're using, no hiccups.

So, in a nutshell, my native web app is the go-to solution for keeping tabs on bank transactions, analyzing data, spotting potential fraud, and securing transactions with signature verification. It's a game-changer for financial institutions and anyone who wants to keep their financial operations in check.
